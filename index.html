									<p><img src="images/main/ewhaMark.png" class="left" width="120" height="120" />
									Intelligence system and Parallel Computer Architecture (IP-CAL) Lab. is founded in March, 2021. Our lab is located in Ewha Womans University. </p>
									<p>Technological advancements in various fields such as computer architecture, big data, data analysis, and many more have led to the active performance of artificial neural network research. Among the various field, we are interested in the computer architecture field.</p>
									<p>Detailed research topics are as follows!</p>

								<h2>Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) Micro-Architecture</h2>
								<p>
									<img src="images/main/gpuArchitecture.png" class="left" width="250" />
									GPUs were first developed to accelerate graphics applications. Games are one major application that relies on the performance of GPUs. When the game application is launched, GPUs start to create 60~120 images every second using a massive number of GPU processors. This massive number of processors recently has begun to be used for general purpose applications such as machine learning algorithms, simulations, and many other applications instead of graphics applications. This paradigm is known as General-Purpose Computing on Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU).
								</p>
								<p>
									Our goal is to maximize the performance of GPUs when general-purpose applications such as machine learning algorithms, simulations, and many more are executed on the GPU hardware. We first identify the bottleneck points on the GPU architecture and propose a new modified architecture that can remove the bottleneck points. To verify our ideas, C/C++/Python based cycle-accurate simulations are used. If you are interested in this topic, you are always welcome to visit our lab.
